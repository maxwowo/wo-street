It's been a while since the last Auckland karaoke bar review and a lot of things have changed, so we're about due for an update.

## Seong Oh

This karaoke bar is the best option if you live in the North Shore, since it's the only one around. It used to be the unofficial gathering spot for intellectuals and cultured individuals alike, but has recently fallen into dilapidation due to a change in their machines. Prior to the change we were to be able to consume a wide variety of songs from obscure vocaloid songs to One Ok Rock, but the song selection has drastically plummeted following the change. Now only popular K-Pop songs are available. The available songs can be searched on the machine manufacturer's [website](https://www.tjmedia.com/tjsong/song_search.asp).

It pains me immeasurably to say that the days of Seong are officially over and that they can no longer be recommended ðŸ˜¢.

Oh and it's called Seong Oh because it might be the owner's name.

## Ace Karaoke

Ace is probably the most recent karaoke bar to open in Auckland CBD. However, despite its name, Ace really ain't the ace of Auckland karaoke bars. Even though its interior is the most modern, their machines don't really have that many songs besides the typcial Chinese songs. The rooms also are quite small compared to the other options in the CBD. On top of that, parking is not trivial since Ace is located on the side of a main road very close to the city center, so street parking won't be available. You'll most likely have to shell out some extra dollarydoos to my boi Wilson.
