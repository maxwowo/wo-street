It's been a while since the last Auckland karaoke bar review and a lot of things have changed, so we're about due for a refresh.

## Seong Oh

This karaoke bar is the best option if you live in the North Shore, since it's the only karaoke place around. It used to be the gathering spot for intellectuals and cultured individuals, but has recently fallen into dilapidation due to a change in their machines. Prior to the change we were to be able to consume a wide variety of songs from obscure vocaloid songs to One Ok Rock, but the song selection has drastically plummeted following the machine change. Now only popular K-Pop songs are available. The available songs can be searched on the machine manufacturer's [website](https://www.tjmedia.com/tjsong/song_search.asp).

It pains me to say that Seong Oh can no longer be recommended ðŸ˜¢.

Oh and it's called Seong Oh because we think that might be the owner's name.
